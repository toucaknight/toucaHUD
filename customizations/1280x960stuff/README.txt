2. go to materials > console and replace both files named "background_upward" and "background_upward_widescreen" with the one from this folder
3. go to materials > vgui > replay > thumbnails > loadouts and replace the "hex_highlight" and the "back" files with the ones from this folder
4. remember to go to your properties in steam and change the width and height to your preferred resolution
